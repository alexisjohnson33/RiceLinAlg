  <p>
A matrix is in Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) if it satisfies the following conditions: </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
    <li>
      <p>
All rows of all zeros are at the bottom. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
If a row is non-zero, its first non-zero entry is 1. (This is called a <span style="color:#99182C"><b class="bf">pivot</b></span>.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
Each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
A pivot in a lower row is to the right of any pivot in a higher row. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
