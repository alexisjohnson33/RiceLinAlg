\beginedxvertical{RREF Defined}

\beginedxtext{Row-Reduced Echelon Form}


A matrix is in Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) if it satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item All rows of all zeros are at the bottom.
\item In any non-zero row, the first non-zero entry is 1.  (This is called a {\keyb{\bf pivot}}.) 
\item Each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column.
\item A pivot in a lower row is to the right of any pivot in a higher row.  
\end{itemize}

\doedxvideo{The Row Reduction Algorithm}{oXO9Iw9KyPo}



\beginedxtext{The Row-Reduction Algorithm}

The following algorithm will always work to reduce a matrix into Row-Reduced Echelon Form.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Swap two rows to get the left-most remaining non-zero entry to the topmost remaining row.  
\item Scale that row to make its leading entry a 1.    
\item Clear all non-zero entries in the column of that pivot (both above and below the pivot) by adding/subtracting multiples of that row to/from other rows.  
\item With that pivot now set, repeat the procedure with the remaining rows.  
\end{itemize}

\endedxtext

This is sometimes called {\keyb{\bf  Gaussian elimination}}.

If a matrix $M$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, we say that 
$M$ is an $m\times n$ matrix.  For instance, 

\[ 
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] \]

is a $3\times 5$ augmented matrix, since it has 3 rows and 5 columns.  The coefficient matrix of the above system would be a $3\times 4$ matrix.

\beginedxvertical{Fields Defined}


\beginedxtext{Fields}

A {\keyb{\bf field}} is, essentially, a set in which one can add, subtract, multiply, and
divide any two elements (other than dividing by zero).  The formal definition is below.  

The field that we will
most commonly use in this course is the set of real numbers $\R$.  Other fields include
the set of complex numbers $\C$, the set of rational numbers $\Q$, and the integers modulo
a prime $p$.  

\begin{edXshowhide}{Formal Definition of a Field}
A field is a set $F$ together with binary operations $+, \cdot$ on $F$ which satisfy the
following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Addition is associative and commutative; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, we have
$a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$ and $a+b  = b+a$.  
\item There is an element $0 \in F$ such that $a+0 = a$ for all $a \in F$.
\item For every $a\in F$, there is an element $-a \in F$ such that $-a + a = 0$.  
\item Multiplication is associative and commutative; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, we have
$a(bc) = (ab)c$ and $ab  = ba$.  
\item There is a non-zero element $1 \in F$ such that $1a = a$ for all $a \in F$.  
\item For every non-zero $a\in F$, there is an element $a\inv$ such that $a\inv a = 1$.  
\item Multiplication distributes over addition; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, $a(b+c) = ab + ac$.  
\end{itemize}
