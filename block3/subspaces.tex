\beginedxvertical{Into, Onto, and Invertibility}






\beginedxproblem{Into and Onto}{\dpa1}

We've noted that a linear transformation has an inverse if and only if it is both into and onto.  
Let's recall our results about when a linear transformation from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$ can or must
be into or onto.  

Suppose $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$ is a linear transformation.


If $n<m$, what can we conclude about $T$?

If $n>m$, what can we conclude about $T$?

\beginedxproblem{Using the Invertible Matrix Theorem}{\dpa1}

Suppose $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix which has at least one free variable.  Can we conclude that the columns of 
$A$ do not span $\R^m$?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Suppose $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix which has at least one free variable. Can we conclude that the columns of $A$ do not span $\R^n$?  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ For the first question, we cannot make that conclusion, since we are not told the matrix is square.  For instance, $\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right]$ has a free variable,
but its columns span $\R^2$.  

For the second question, we know the matrix is square, so the Invertible Matrix Theorem applies.
Since $A$ has a free variable, we can conclude that none of the conditions in the Invertible Matrix Theorem
are true.  In particular, its columns do not span $\R^n$.

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  If  $A$ and $B$ are square matrices, and 
$AB = I$, then $BA = I$, and the two matrices are inverses of each other.  


This allows us to add two lines to the Invertible Matrix Theorem: 

{\keya{\bf{Invertible Matrix Theorem (updated).}}}  
Suppose that $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ is a linear transformation
with (square) standard matrix $A$.  Then the following conditions are all equivalent (i.e., either all of
them are true, or all of them are false):

\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is into.
\item $\mathrm{Ker}(T) = \{ \veco \}$.  
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent. 
\item $Ax = \veco$ has only the trivial solution.
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every column (has no free variables).  
\item $A$ row reduces to the identity matrix.  
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every row.  
\item For every $v\in \R^n$, the equation $Ax = v$ is consistent.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\R^n$.  
\item $T$ is onto.  
\item $T$ is invertible.
\item $A$ is invertible.
\item There is a matrix $B$ such that $AB = I_n$.  ($A$ has a right inverse.)
\item There is a matrix $B$ such that $BA = I_n$.  ($A$ has a left inverse.)
