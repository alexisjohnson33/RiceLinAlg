\beginedxvertical{Rank and Nullity}


\beginedxtext{Definitions}


{\keya{\bf{Definitions.}}}  
Given a linear transformation $T: V\rightarrow W$, the {\keyb{\bf{nullity}}} of $T$ is the
dimension of the kernel of $T$, and the {\keyb{\bf{rank}}} of $T$ is the
dimension of the image of $T$. 

If a matrix $A$ is the standard matrix for a linear transformation $T:\R^n \rightarrow \R^m$, 
then the rank and nullity of $A$ are the same as the rank and nullity of $T$.

\beginedxvertical{Nullity}

\beginedxproblem{Example 1}{\dpa2}


Let $T: \R^{8}\rightarrow \R^{11}$ be a linear transformation with standard matrix $A$.  If 
there are six pivots when $A$ is row-reduced, what is the nullity of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="2" feqin="1"}

\edXsolution{
We showed in the video that the nullity of $T$ equals the number of free variables in $A$.  $A$ has eight columns, and six pivots when row reduce, so there must be $8-6$, or 2, free variables.

\beginedxvertical{Rank}


\doedxvideo{Calculating Rank}{rnePz12JGvk}


\beginedxproblem{Basis for Image}{\dpa1}

Suppose $T$ has a standard matrix $A$ which row reduces to the matrix 
\[
R = \left[\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 2 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 0 
\end{array} \right].
\]

True or False: We can conclude that the list
\[ \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right];  
\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right];  \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
\end{array} \right] \right\} \]
is a basis for the image of $T$.  



\edXabox{expect="False" options="True","False"}

\edXsolution{False.  The first, third, and fourth columns have pivots, but this means that the
first, third, and fourth columns of $A$ will form a basis for $\mathrm{Image}(T)$, not necessarily
the first, third, and fourth columns of $R$.}

\beginedxvertical{Summary}

\beginedxtext{Summary}


Let $T: \R^{n}\rightarrow \R^{m}$ be a linear transformation with standard matrix $A$. 
The nullity of $T$ will equal the number of free variables when $A$ is row reduced, and the
rank of $T$ will equal the number of pivot columns when $A$ is row reduced.  The columns of $A$ which
correspond to the pivots will form a basis of the image of $T$.
