\begin{edXshowhide}{How to Enter a Vector}

To enter a vector in $\R^n$ such as $\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2  \\ 3 \end{array} \right]$, you can either:
\begin{itemize}
\item
enter it as 
you would a $3\times 1$ matrix: [[1],[2],[3]]  
\item
or, you can enter it as <1,2,3>
\end{itemize}

Use decimals only.
