\beginedxvertical{Rank and Nullity}


\doedxvideo{Defining Rank and Nullity}{uinL2McUGAA}


\beginedxtext{Definitions}


{\keya{\bf{Definitions.}}}  
Given a linear transformation $T: V\rightarrow W$, the {\keyb{\bf{nullity}}} of $T$ is the
dimension of the kernel of $T$, and the {\keyb{\bf{rank}}} of $T$ is the
dimension of the image of $T$. 

If a matrix $A$ is the standard matrix for a linear transformation $T:\R^n \rightarrow \R^m$, 
then the rank and nullity of $A$ are the same as the rank and nullity of $T$.

\beginedxvertical{Rank and Nullity Questions}


\beginedxproblem{Rank and Nullity 1}{\dpa1}

Let $T: \R^2 \rightarrow \R^2$ be the transformation that rotates vectors by $90^\circ$ counterclockwise.

What is the rank of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="2"}


What is the nullity of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="0"}


\edXsolution{Since $T$ is a rotation, the image of $T$ is all of $\R^2$, which has dimension 2.  Thus, the rank of $T$ is 2.  The only vector that is sent to $\veco$ by a rotation is $\veco$ itself.  Thus, the kernel of $T$ is 0-dimensional.

\beginedxproblem{Rank and Nullity 2}{\dpa1}

Let $T: \R^2 \rightarrow \R^2$ be the transformation that sends all vectors to $\veco$.  


What is the rank of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="0"}


What is the nullity of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="2"}


\edXsolution{The image of $T$ is $\{\veco\}$.  Thus, the image of $T$ is 0-dimensional.  The kernel of $T$ is the entire domain, so all of $\R^2$, which is 2-dimensional.
}

\beginedxproblem{Rank and Nullity 3}{\dpa1}

Suppose $\dim V = 5$.  Let $T: V\rightarrow V$ be a linear transformation.  If we know that $T$ is
not onto, what is the largest possible rank of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="4"}


\edXsolution{Since $T$ is not onto, the image of $T$ is some strict subspace of $V$.  Thus, the image must have dimension less that 5.  To prove that it is possible for the dimension of the image to be 4, we give an example.\\

Let $B=\{v_1,\ldots, v_5\}$ be a basis for $V$.  Let the standard matrix for $T$ be defined, with respect to this basis, by the following matrix
$$\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1&0&0&0&0 \\ 0&1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0&0\\
0&0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0&0&0\\
\end{array} \right].$$
Then, $\{v_1,\ldots, v_4\}$ is a linearly independent set that spans the image of $T$.  Thus, it is a basis for the image of $T$ consisting of 4 vectors.}

\beginedxtext{Rank-Nullity Theorem}

\beginedxvertical{Examples}

\beginedxproblem{Rank-Nullity Question 1}{\dpa1}

Let $T: \R^9 \rightarrow \R^3$ be a linear transformation.  If the image of $T$ is a two-dimensional 
subspace of $\R^3$, what is the dimension of its kernel?

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="7"}


\edXsolution{The image of $T$ is two-dimensional, and thus the rank of $T$ is 2.  The dimension of the domain of $T$ is 9.  Therefore, the nullity of $T$ is $9-2=7$.

\beginedxproblem{Rank-Nullity Question 2}{\dpa1}

Let $T: P_4 \rightarrow \R^7$ be a linear transformation.  What is the largest possible rank of $T$?

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="5"}

Is is possible for $T$ to be onto?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{The list $\{1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4\}$ forms a basis for $P_4$.  The image of each element in this list is a vector in $\R^7$.  The dimension of this image is maximixed when all 5 vectors are linearly independent.  Thus, the largest possible rank of $T$ is 5.\\

The transformation $T$ is onto if and only if the image is all of $\R^7$, which has dimension 7.  But, the maximum dimension of the image is 5.

\beginedxproblem{Rank-Nullity Question 3}{\dpa1}

Let $T: \R^4 \rightarrow P_6$ be a linear transformation which is not into.  What is the maximum possible
dimension of the image of $T$?    

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="3"}


\edXsolution{The transformation $T$ is into if and only if the dimension of the kernel, and thus the nullity, is 0.  By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the image of $T$ is maximized when the nullity of $T$ is minimized.  Assuming that $T$ is not into, the minimum nullity of $T$ is 1.  Therefore, the maximum dimension of the image of $T$ is $4-1=3$.

\beginedxproblem{Rank-Nullity Question 4}{\dpa1}

Suppose $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces with the same (finite) dimension $n$.  

If $T: V\rightarrow W$ is a linear transformation which is onto, what is the rank of $T$?  


\edXabox{type="formula" expect="n" samples="n@1:2#5" feqin="1" tolerance=".001"}

Therefore, what is the nullity of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="formula" expect="0" samples="n@1:2#5" feqin="1" tolerance=".001"}

Therefore, we can conclude that $T$ must be what?  (Answer yourself.)  

\edXsolution{Since $T$ is onto, the dimension of the image is equal to the dimension of the codomain.  Thus, the dimension of the image, and the rank of $T$, is $n$.  Since the dimension of the domain is $n$, by the rank nullity theorem, the nullity of $T$ is $n-n=0$.

\beginedxvertical{One Last Example}

\doedxvideo{Another Rank-Nullity Example}{EOJeHCQHxRw}


\beginedxproblem{Question}{\dpa1}

Suppose $\dim V = 14$ and let $W$ be a subspace of $V$. 

True or false: If we construct a linear transformation $T: V \rightarrow \R^2$ such that $W = \mathrm{Ker}(T)$,
then $\dim W$ must be 12.  


\edXabox{expect="False" options="True","False"}


\edXsolution{We can realize this situation when $W$ has dimension 12, 13 or 14.  This is because the image of a linear transformation $T: V \rightarrow \R^2$ is not necessarily all of $\R^2$.  For example, may construct $T$ which maps every vector in $V$ to $\veco$.  In that case, the nullity of $T$ is 14.  Then, since $W = \mathrm{Ker}(T)$, the dimension of $W$ is 14.

\beginedxproblem{Example 1}{\dpa2}


Let $T: \R^{8}\rightarrow \R^{11}$ be a linear transformation with standard matrix $A$.  If 
there are six pivots when $A$ is row-reduced, what is the nullity of $T$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="2" feqin="1"}

\edXsolution{
We showed in the video that the nullity of $T$ equals the number of free variables in $A$.  $A$ has eight columns, and six pivots when row reduce, so there must be $8-6$, or 2, free variables.

\beginedxproblem{Basis for Image}{\dpa1}

Suppose $T$ has a standard matrix $A$ which row reduces to the matrix 
\[
R = \left[\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -2 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  & 2 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 0 
\end{array} \right].
\]

True or False: We can conclude that the list
\[ \left\{ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right];  
\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array} \right];  \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0
\end{array} \right] \right\} \]
is a basis for the image of $T$.  



\edXabox{expect="False" options="True","False"}

\edXsolution{False.  The first, third, and fourth columns have pivots, but this means that the
first, third, and fourth columns of $A$ will form a basis for $\mathrm{Image}(T)$, not necessarily
the first, third, and fourth columns of $R$.}

\beginedxvertical{Summary}

\beginedxtext{Summary of Rank and Nullity for Linear Transformations from R^n to R^m}


Let $T: \R^{n}\rightarrow \R^{m}$ be a linear transformation with standard matrix $A$. 
The nullity of $T$ will equal the number of free variables when $A$ is row reduced, and the
rank of $T$ will equal the number of pivot columns when $A$ is row reduced.  The columns of $A$ which
correspond to the pivots will form a basis of the image of $T$.
